This is just a demo and not the most up to date version. I frequently change themes and UI, this is just saving the functionality of the project
in this version I have voice to text, text to voice, GPT API is linked from backend to frontend, and you can click on different themes which will 
send a request to the backend and update the prompt for the GPT API
