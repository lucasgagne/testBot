This is connected to the GPT-API and has voice-to-text and text-to-voice allowing users to speak to GPT and hear its responses. It has different themes to chose from including spanish Themes to 
practice your spanish. My API key will get banned if I post it so the current files will not work without a GPT-API key, but all other code is 
functional. 

This project is created with Python Flask, it has HTML, CSS, JS, and Python in the backend.
